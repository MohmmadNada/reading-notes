## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received

### The Advice: Communicate!
**communicate, communicate, communicate!**

#### What Do You Mean Communicate?
Even if you think you understand the problem, you should take some very important steps before moving forward.

##### 1. Restate the Question (Problem Domain)
Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. **Restate the question for them and seek affirmation**.
example:
“**So I’d like to restate the problem to you to make sure I understand what you’re looking for**. The sole parameter for my function will be an integer. The sole output of my function will be an incrementing array, starting from the number 1 and ending at the input number.
If a number is a multiple of 3, the output will instead be `fizz`. If a number is a multiple of 5, the output will instead be `buzz`. However, if the output is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output will instead be `fizzbuzz`. **Is my understanding correct?**”

##### 2. Ask About Edge Cases
it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs
“**Now that I confirmed my understanding of the problem, I’d like to ask about some potential edge cases.** Is it possible that the input would be a type other than a number? If so, what should the function do? Can the input be 0 or negative? Again, if so, what should the function do?”
##### 2. Ask About Test Cases
Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”
##### 4. Visualization
##### 5. Algorithm

##### 4. Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.
you can ask if your pseudocode makes sense , may be want to discuss your pseudocode with you
##### 5. Verification

##### 6. Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
(Finally Start Writing Code)
convert your pseudocode into actual code.
> note: If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.
At this point, don’t hesitate to **ask if your solution looks good!**
##### 7. Big (O)

### Stuck? Ask for Help!
it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally. For example:

“I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
The answer might be “no, I’d like to see if you can solve it from here on your own,” but it also very well might be a “yes” with a useful tip!

### Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview
You should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview. Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the interview? Ask them! Furthermore, you can ask if there is anything in particular you should prepare. They very well might give you hints like specifying the language in which they’ll ask questions, the number of questions, the style of question (e.g., develop an algorithm vs. find the bug). They might tell you whether you’ll be sitting at a computer or standing at a whiteboard — very useful information you might be able to use to practice or, at the very least, mentally prepare.

### We’re All Human
Above all, remember that we’re all human. Your interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of a technical interview. Your interviewer has probably seen quite a few candidates sweating it out, but possibly very few open who openly discuss problems in a conversational manner. If you can achieve this, you’ll be in great shape.

### What Has Your Experience Been?
Have you been in a technical interview where communication saved you? Have you had the opposite experience? Let me know in the comments! I’d love to hear about your experiences.

## 7 tips to ace a programming interview

### 1) Take a few minutes.

Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer:

“Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”
Think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach. Then re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded. Don’t forget to provide your reasoning!
So, I think that, since the array is sorted, it makes the most sense to do something like a binary search here. Here are the general steps that I think are involved in the solution: …”

### 2) Write down the steps of the solution.
Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way.

### 3) Write pseudocode first.
No worrying about off-by-one issues, or index arithmetic; just verifying that our logic is correct.

### 4) Don’t sweat the small stuff.
<!-- لا تقلق من الشغلات الصغيرة  -->
They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.  
**If you can’t remember something like this, it’s often acceptable to say that you’d look it up.**

“…and here, I’d use whatever the list.contains() equivalent is in JavaScript. I know it’s not contains, but I can’t remember the method name right now, so we’ll call it contains() for now and I’d look it up right now if I were coding this.”

### 5) Sit down. Be humble.

A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. For example:

* Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
* Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
* How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
* Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
* Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
* Are you honest (especially about yourself)?

### 6) Come prepared.
If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. 
No matter what material you use, make sure you get enough HOBIS and your next interview will be a much better experience.

### 7) Review your work.
You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible. This is reasonable, but:

Think about how silly you look if your solution is not right.

Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.

focus on these two areas: 
1. Algorithmic efficiency
2. Correctness
