# A beginner's guide to Big O Notation
describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 
depend on time and space 
* O(1)
an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (regardless space )

* O(N)
an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

* O(NÂ²)
algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

* O(2^N)

algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. 

#### Logarithms
It is a way we can get something , different code , the same result , every way is a logarithm
