>= Grater than or equal to 



we can use more than one comparison operators , calls this case logical operators 
and , I I or ! not 


note : logical experssions are evaluated from left to right 
if the left side give enough info. to get the answer , no need to evaluate right side . 


Loops check condition; check the condition if true it will be check again until check condition returns false . 
type loops : 
FOR (limiting time ) and while( until the condition is false ) and do while 
 

 General form (for)
  for (var i = 0 ; i < 10;i--  ) {
      var s = i +  5;
  }

 General form (while
 while (i < 10) {
msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br I>';
i++;) ;
 }
