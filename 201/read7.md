# HTML-Tables
## What's a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format
`<table>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Saturday</th>
<td>15</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
</table> `

we can use ```<td colspan="2">``` to show spanning column
we can use ``` <td rowspan="2">Movie</td>``` to show spanning raw

### For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.





### Functions, Methods, and Objects
Creating an object: constructor notation 
    var hotal = new oBJECT ();
    hotal.property = "anything";
    hotal.checkAvalability = function(){
    return ,,,,, ;
    }; ``` 

Update an object 
``` name.property = value ; ```

## CREATING OBJECTS USING
CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX: Name.PropertyName()

## CREATE & ACCESS OBJECTS
CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION : we create one and make a new one by change his properties.
we can delete propertyby : 
> delete ObjectName.Property


### OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION

The function can be used to create multiple objects.

> note: this commonly objects and functions


### A METHOD OF AN OBJECT ; function inside object 

### **Storing data** : 
in arrays and objects the name calls key 

note ; If the order of the items is important, use an array.
