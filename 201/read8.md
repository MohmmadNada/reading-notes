2. Inline elements 
img ,  b , i 

## Controlling the Position of Elements
1. Normal flow (default behavior (
2. Relative Positioning (keep it in the normal flow , move it but in the containar block)
3. absolute positioning (out fo normal flow)
4. Fixed Positioning (fixed when scroll uup and down)
5. Floating Elements (out of flow)


> note : use z-index to avoid overlap , it allows you to control which one on the top , the element who has higher number will show on the top
